# Ridesharing

I recently started using [Poparide](https://www.poparide.com/) both as a driver and passenger.

So far so good! Makes a lot of sense to carpool/rideshare so long as it can be done comfortably and safely.

The max amount that can be charged is $0.15 per kilometre so by price it compares very favourably to bus, trail, and flying.
