# Leap year

It's an interesting question as to whether or not we are paid to [work the extra day](https://www.cp24.com/news/hourly-vs-salaried-are-you-getting-paid-for-an-extra-day-of-work-on-feb-29-1.6786798) during a leap year.

The number of work days in the year changes depending whether it is a leap year, yes, but I think even moreso on which day of the week the first business day falls - if it's a Monday on January 2nd then the year will have more work days than if the 2nd is a Saturday.

At any rate, I wonder if the most fair way to pay would be hourly:

* If the hours are predictably 37.5 per week then it should be predictable and easy to pay hourly.
* If the hours are all over the place then it might be more fair for both workers and company to pay hourly. The contract could lay out a minimum number of guaranteed hours per week and then it could even give some extra flexibility for employers during times of lower demand.
