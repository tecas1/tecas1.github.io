# Groceries

Stopped in at [Fiddes Wholesale Produce](https://www.instagram.com/fwp_hamilton/?hl=en) on my way home on the rail trail today.

Knew about the store from a friend, she took me to visit years ago and found it to be a pretty neat experience. No prices on display, cashier mostly looks at your basket and tells you a number. Very no-frills but certainly not [No-Frills](https://www.nofrills.ca/).

Was curious how prices compared to others stores so I got out my kitchen scale and looked at what this, my $18 basket of food from Fiddes, would cost if using advertised online prices for other stores.
