# Affordable Rent

Can we make a budget for a new apartment building such that it is affordable for a person currently making $40,000 a year?

Here is what the income side might look like:

| item    | per month | per year |
| - | - | - |
| rent at 35% of income | $1,167 | $14,000 |
| operations as half of rent | $583 | $7,000 | 
| mortgage payments with remainder | $583 | $7,000 |

The operations would cover upkeep and property management; the remainding $7,000 per year from the rent could be used to support a $200,000 interest-only mortgage at 3.5% interest. That's not building a lot but also is a firm constraint based on the $40,000 income. So we can't do much here - but maybe we can change the way the mortgage works.

Let's try again where we pay less than interest-only to start but then increase the rent each year to follow wage growth. The rent would look as below:

The mortgage would grow in size at first because we are paying less than the interest - but then turn the corner and head for zero as income grows relative to outstanding mortgage balance. By paying some (enough) of the interest we are able to catch up.

And because the property value tends to go up over time we should expect to see a steady decline in loan to value even from day one.

Here is the budget I made to look into it:
- $500,000 to build unit
- mortgage starts at $312,500 = 62.5% loan to value
- mortgage interest rate of 3.5% to match Government of Canada long term bonds
- expenses, income and property all grow at 2.5% per year

The result is a 4.2% return on investment for the owner of the building. This come from appreciation of the building and paydown of the mortgage.

It's not a huge return but perhaps we could see it as a social investment. Canada Pension Plan could make the downpayment, sign up local not-for-profit companies or municipalities to build and run the buildings. CPP pensioners would then pay for and live in the buildings, which would be nice. And the mortgages could be from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Local partnerships could drive down cost, perhaps that would be a municipality granting the land or reducing fees or a company subsidizing to help attract workers.

It would be nice to target the investment as some percent of growth in gross domestic product each year. GDP is about $2 trillion per year and if it grows at 6% per year then we would have 10% of 6% of $2 trillion to sustainably invest each year = $12 billion dollars per year. That would be the downpayment; the total value built could be more like $32 billion per year. That would be enough to house 100,000 people and, if done every year, could perhaps be a start on housing affordability. And it might return a positive profit.
