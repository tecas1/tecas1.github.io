# Affordable Rent

Let's say affordable rent is 35% of income.

Can we make a sustainable budget for a new build where rent tracks along at this percent of income?

The mortgage would grow at the start but then turn and head for zero as incomes grow relative to the outstanding mortgage balance.

And hopefully with the building value going upward we would see a steady decrease in loan to value.

Here is the budget I made to look into it:
- $500,000 to build unit
- mortgage starts at $312,500 = 62.5% loan to value
- mortgage interest rate of 3.5% to match Government of Canada long term bonds
- rent starts at $14,000 per year = $1,167 per month = 35% of a $40,000 per year income
- operating cost starts at $7,000 per year
- assumes expenses, income and property all grow at 2.5% per year
- 4.20% return on investment for the owner of the building based on appreciation and mortgage pay-down

That's not a huge return but perhaps we could see it as a social investment. Canada Pension Plan could invest and build a bunch, sign up local not-for-profit companies or municipalities to run the buildings. CPP pensioners would then pay for and live in the buildings, which would be nice. And the mortgages could be from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. Local partnerships could drive down cost, perhaps that would be a municipality granting the land or reducing fees or a company subsidizing to help attract workers.

I was thinking that perhaps we could target 10% of gross domestic product towards public ownership of some housing. GDP is about $2 trillion per year and if it grows at 6% per year then we would have 10% of 6% of $2 trillion to sustainably invest each year = $12 billion dollars per year.
