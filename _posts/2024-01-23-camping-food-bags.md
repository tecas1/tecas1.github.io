# Camping food bags

This sort of [food bag](https://www.walmart.com/ip/30-pcs-Mylar-Bags-1-Gallon-Smell-Proof-10-Mil-Thick-with-Oxygen-Absorbers-500CC-Resealable-Food-Grade-Leak-Proof-Air-Tight-USA/5262653894) worked well for us on the last camping trip:

* place dry food in bags before trip
* hang in bear bag during trip
* fill with boiling water to rehydrate
* eat from bag: no plates needed
* fold flat and put back in bear bag
* carry home and wash in dishwasher
  
Greatly simplified cooking and cleaning in camp!
