### Car theft

The cost of car theft in Canada is now over a [billion dollars per year](https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/the-top-10-stolen-cars-in-canada-1004240044/). 

And, according to the article, some car models come with a 1+% chance of disappearance each year. On a $40,000 car that averages out to $400 per year - $33 per month in theft loss risk.

# Push-to-start vehicle thefts

The simplicity of push-to-start theft is remarkable: extend the keyless entry system signal to the car and off you go.

Here are a few things that I think could be done:
                                                          
# Prevent the signal from being stolen

We could design the fob to have an [accelerometer](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-accelerometers-will-soon-thwart-car-thieves) and only transmit when the fob is or has recently been in motion. It turns off when you put the keys on the counter extending battery life and increasing security.

We could even have the fob regularly send acceleration readings (ax,ay,az), a current time or random token (t), and a signed passcode P=f(ax,ay,az,t) to the car as a message (ax,ay,az,t,P). The car can then check similarity with its acceleration readings and verify the signing of the message. The accelerations should match closely and the message should be properly signed. The car could be set up to only run if it has ongoing verified contact with the fob.

# Prevent the car from starting

Would people be comfortable starting their car with facial recognition or by drawing a pattern on the entertainment console? Could we talk to the car and use voice recognition? Logging in to the car would grant access to our favourite music or maybe adjust the mirrors for us and bring up our top ten destination selections. Offering all the above options might be nice.

I think I would prefer the voice recognition: the car could say "Hello, where are we going today?". I could then say "to the office" and it would bring up a suggested driving route including traffic information. Each person could have their own sort of prompt. "What kind of music today?". Play "Me and Bobby McGee".

# See where the car is going: shutdown remotely or intervene

The key would be installing a [vehicle tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_tracking_system) and reporting back using a wireless data connection. Perhaps it could be on the [diagnostics port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) but ideally it would be tricky for thieves to remove.

A side benefit from vehicle tracking would be the ability to reduce insurance premiumns through car insurance [telematics](https://www.sonnet.ca/blog/auto/insurance/what-is-usage-based-insurance) program. The installation and monthly cost of such a system could be funded by the insurance company and repaid with a tab sort of system as is often done for cellphones.

Feedback from insurance could lead to safer driving. Apparently [80%](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/80-of-drivers-think-theyre-safer-than-others-on-the-road--survey-97058.aspx) or even [93%](https://www.smithlawco.com/blog/2017/december/do-most-drivers-really-think-they-are-above-aver) of drivers think they are safer others on the road. And feedback could also help drivers decide when or where to travel. The cost could change based on where I am, when I am there, and weather conditions.

Suppose your location is thought to be at X, your partner is thought to be at Y, the car is at Z, and the driving profile does not match any known driver or the known driver styles of the owners. We could have the car send a message to the owners to confirm who is driving. Additional measures could be taken if the car were driving to say the [docks](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/port-of-montreal-a-theft-hub-for-toronto-s-stolen-vehicles-shipped-abroad/article_e2049b4a-d9b4-5360-9b5a-b09cd479336a.html) where other known stolen cars have gone.
