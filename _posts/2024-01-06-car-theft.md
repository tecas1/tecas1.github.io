# Car theft

The cost of car theft in Canada is now over a [billion dollars](https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/the-top-10-stolen-cars-in-canada-1004240044/) per year with some cars having a 1+% chance of disappearance each year. On a $40,000 car the theft risk averages out to $400 per year ($33 per month) in replacement cost - not to mentiond additional costs and inconvenience.

### Push-to-start vehicle thefts

The simplicity of push-to-start theft is remarkable: extend the signal from the keyless entry fob to the car. The fob could be sitting on your kitchen counter but if it can be read in the driveway then it can be used to unlock and drive away in moments.

Here are a few things that I think could be done:
                                                          
### Prevent signal from being stolen

We could design the fob to have a built-in [accelerometer](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-accelerometers-will-soon-thwart-car-thieves) and only transmit when the fob is or has recently been in motion. This would increase battery life and decrease risk.

We could go a step further and have the fob or a cellphone send acceleration readings (ax,ay,az), a current time or random token (t), and a signed passcode P = f(ax,ay,az,t) to the car as a message (ax,ay,az,t,P) every few seconds. The car can could then shut down or send a warning message if the acceleration readings from the fob differ greatly from its own sensors or if the signing of the message cannot be verified.

### Prevent car from starting

Would people be comfortable starting their car with facial or voice recognition or by drawing a pattern on the entertainment console? Logging in to the car would grant access to our favourite music or maybe adjust the mirrors and bring up navigation help.

I think I would prefer the voice recognition: the car could say "Hello, where are we going today?". I could then say "to the office" and it would bring up a suggested driving route including traffic information. Each person could have their own sort of prompt. "What kind of music today?". Play "Me and Bobby McGee".

Communication with a third party monitoring service in conjunction with tracking could help reduce the risk of [hacks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hacking-cars-a-guide-tutorial-on-how-to-hack-a-car-5eafcfbbb7ec/) via the [on-board diagnostics port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics).

### Prevent driving away

The key would be installing a [vehicle tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_tracking_system) and reporting back to a central station using a wireless data connection. Perhaps the system would be on a [diagnostics port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) but ideally it would be tricky for thieves to remove and allow for remote shutdown.

The vehicle tracking could pay for itself (and more) by taking part in a [telematics](https://www.sonnet.ca/blog/auto/insurance/what-is-usage-based-insurance) program to lower insurance premiums.

Feedback from such a system could lead to safer driving and counter the belief that [80%](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/80-of-drivers-think-theyre-safer-than-others-on-the-road--survey-97058.aspx) or even [93%](https://www.smithlawco.com/blog/2017/december/do-most-drivers-really-think-they-are-above-aver) of drivers think they are safer than others on the road. 

Feedback could also help drivers decide when or where to travel. The cost of insurance change based on where I am, when I am there, weather conditions or even how many people are in the car (and could be injured in a collision or cause a distraction leading to a collision). Changing behaviour could increase safety.

Suppose your location is thought to be at X, your partner is thought to be at Y, the car is at Z, and the driving profile does not match any known driver or the known driver styles of the owners. We could have the car send a message to the owners to confirm who is driving or prompt additional authentication in the vehicle. Location could also be consider, say on a route to [ports](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/port-of-montreal-a-theft-hub-for-toronto-s-stolen-vehicles-shipped-abroad/article_e2049b4a-d9b4-5360-9b5a-b09cd479336a.html) where other known stolen cars have gone.
