# Car theft

The cost of car theft in Canada is now over a [billion dollars](https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/insurance/the-top-10-stolen-cars-in-canada-1004240044/) per year with some cars having a 1+% chance of disappearance each year. On a $40,000 car that theft risk averages out to $400 per year ($33 per month).

### Push-to-start vehicle thefts

The simplicity of push-to-start theft is remarkable: intercept the keyless entry system signal from your home and send it to the car. Doors open, engine starts, off you go.

Here are a few things that I think could be done:
                                                          
### Prevent signal from being stolen

We could design the fob to have a built-in [accelerometer](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-accelerometers-will-soon-thwart-car-thieves) and only transmit when the fob is or has recently been in motion. This would increase battery life and decrease risk.

We could go a step further and have the fob send acceleration readings (ax,ay,az), a current time or random token (t), and a signed passcode P = f(ax,ay,az,t) to the car as a message (ax,ay,az,t,P) every few seconds. The car can could then shut down or send a warning message if the acceleration readings from the fob differ greatly from its own sensors or if the signing of the message cannot be verified.

### Prevent car from starting

Would people be comfortable starting their car with facial or voice recognition or by drawing a pattern on the entertainment console? Logging in to the car would grant access to our favourite music or maybe adjust the mirrors and bring up navigation help.

I think I would prefer the voice recognition: the car could say "Hello, where are we going today?". I could then say "to the office" and it would bring up a suggested driving route including traffic information. Each person could have their own sort of prompt. "What kind of music today?". Play "Me and Bobby McGee".

### See where car is going: shut down or intervene

The key would be installing a [vehicle tracking system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_tracking_system) and reporting back to a central station using a wireless data connection. Perhaps the system would be on a [diagnostics port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) but ideally it would be tricky for thieves to remove and allow for remote shutdown.

The vehicle tracking could pay for itself (and more) by taking part in a [telematics](https://www.sonnet.ca/blog/auto/insurance/what-is-usage-based-insurance) program to lower insurance premiums.

Feedback from such a system could lead to safer driving and debunk the over-confident belief that [80%](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/ca/news/breaking-news/80-of-drivers-think-theyre-safer-than-others-on-the-road--survey-97058.aspx) or even [93%](https://www.smithlawco.com/blog/2017/december/do-most-drivers-really-think-they-are-above-aver) of drivers think they are safer than others on the road. 

Feedback could also help drivers decide when or where to travel. The cost of insurance change based on where I am, when I am there, weather conditions or even how many people are in the car (and could be injured in a collision or cause a distraction leading to a collision). Changing behaviour could increase safety.

Suppose your location is thought to be at X, your partner is thought to be at Y, the car is at Z, and the driving profile does not match any known driver or the known driver styles of the owners. We could have the car send a message to the owners to confirm who is driving. Additional measures could be taken if the car were driving to risky locations, say [docks](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/port-of-montreal-a-theft-hub-for-toronto-s-stolen-vehicles-shipped-abroad/article_e2049b4a-d9b4-5360-9b5a-b09cd479336a.html) where other known stolen cars have gone.
